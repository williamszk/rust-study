The problem with compiling inside a container is that we'll not benefit from caching. 
So the compilation needs to happen from zero.

Sadly the developer will need to have rust installed in their machine to work in this project.

What happens if we try to compile again with just a minor change?

It is similar.

Let's experiment with compiling in the host machine.

cd dustr
time cargo build
cd -

cargo build
Compiling dustr v0.1.0 (/home/ubuntu/rust-study/dustr/dustr)
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 18.35s
# >>>>>>>>>>>>>> 18.35s

time cargo build
cd -
bash: cd: dustr: No such file or directory
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.20s

It took 69s to compile from scratch in the host machine. This doesn't take in
consideration the time to download the libraries.
