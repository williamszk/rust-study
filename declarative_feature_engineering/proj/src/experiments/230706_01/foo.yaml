# You can specify arrays or lists on a single line.
items: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
names: [ "one", "two", "three", "four" ]

# we can also represent arrays as a list like this:
items-list:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3
  - 4
  - 5
names-list:
  - "one"
  - "two"
  - "three"
  - "four"

items-as-list:
  - things:
      thing1: huey
      things2: dewey
      thing3: louie
  - other things:
      key: value
# this will be translated into a list of dicts which has just one key and 
# a dictionary inside
# items-as-list : [
  # {'things': {'thing1': 'huey', 'things2': 'dewey', 'thing3': 'louie'}}, 
  # {'other things': {'key': 'value'}}
# ]

# so how do we represent a list of dictionaries?
# this is how
my-another-list:
  - key1: value1
    key2: value2
  - key1: value3
    key2: value4

# representing dictionaries inline
