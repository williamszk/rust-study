# Objective

The idea of this project is to build simple math and linear algebra functions
that can make later machine learning like operations

Build some math functions in this package. Later we can expand to machine learning and statistics.

## To-do

- Build some functions to do matrix operations.
- Build ordinary least squares.
- Build an optimization algorithm.
